Dear Sir,
I have been voracious regarding various programming languages be it c,c++ or java. My love for programming languages kind of compelled me to take Python for everybody course which I don't regret a bit. Web development is something that I always wanted to learn. I am really inquisitive about how websites run and function. Well to be honest with you this is not the only reason. Covid has made the competition even bigger as if it wasn't big already. The best of the best are getting selected presently. I don't want to get lost in this tussle and make full use of the time by taking this course which I believe will eventually help me with my resume. Tell you what that Python for everybody boosted my confidence big time and now I want to take this course and go ahead. I hope that you accept my financial aid. I will leave no stone unturned and make sure you don't regret your decision.
Thank you
